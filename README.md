# 42 Kernel From Scratch <a href="https://github.com/Kbz-8/42_KFS/actions/workflows/build.yml"><img src="https://github.com/Kbz-8/42_KFS/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg"></a>

A minimalist kernel from scratch, written in [Zig 0.13](https://ziglang.org/download/0.13.0/).

## Overview

**42_KFS** is a low-level educational operating system project. It is designed to help understand OS fundamentals, boot processes, memory management, and hardware interactionâ€”all implemented in Zig for safety and performance.

## Features

- Written entirely in Zig 0.13 for modern language safety and performance
- Minimalist kernel: simple, clear, and well-documented codebase
- Bootloader setup and kernel entry
- Basic device drivers (VGA text output, keyboard input, etc.)
- **A shell:**
